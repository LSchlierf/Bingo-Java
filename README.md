## Functionality

### General

With this Code, you can create and print Bingo Cards from txt files. As soon as you place a txt file in [the corresponding folder](src/BingoParts/Sets), you can create a randomized BingoCard from the entries in the file.  
You can print it to the console (looks best with a monospaced font), or use the main method in [ConsoleGame.java](src/ConsoleGame/ConsoleGame.java) to automatically create a set and mark off the fields.  
I have provided an [example txt file](src/BingoParts/Sets/example.txt), which conatins numbers from 1 to 30. This is just to demonstrate the functionality; the actual entries can be whatever you want, including funny events that might happen.  

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic functionality
- [x] Printing to console
- [x] Console bingo game
- [ ] Printing to PDF 
- [ ] GUI for easily creating sets and printing cards
