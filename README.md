# Code for Creating and printing Bingo cards from txt files

## Functionality

### General

With this Code, you can create and print Bingo Cards from txt files. As soon as you place a txt file in [the corresponding folder](https://github.com/LSchlierf/Bingo/tree/main/src/BingoParts/Sets), you can create a randomized BingoCard from the entries in the file.  
You can print it to the console (looks best with a monospaced font), or use the main method in [ConsoleGame.java](https://github.com/LSchlierf/Bingo/tree/main/src/ConsoleGame/ConsoleGame.java) to automatically create a set and mark off the fields.
